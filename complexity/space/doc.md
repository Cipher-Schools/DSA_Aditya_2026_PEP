Space complexity is the amount of memory (RAM) an algorithm uses to execute, relative to the size of the input. It is expressed using **Big O notation**.

It includes two components:

1. **Fixed Part:** Memory for constants, simple variables, and code instruction space (independent of input size).
2. **Variable Part:** Memory for dynamic allocations (like arrays or objects) and the call stack (for recursion) that grows as the input () grows.

### **Why It Matters**

While time is often the primary concern, space is a "hard limit." If an algorithm takes too long, the user waits. If an algorithm runs out of memory, the program crashes (e.g., `StackOverflowError` or `OutOfMemoryError`).

### **Common Space Complexities**

#### **1. Constant Space: **

The algorithm uses the same amount of memory regardless of the input size. It does not allocate new structures proportional to the input.

* **Example:** Sorting an array "in-place" (like Bubble Sort) or swapping two variables.
* **Why:** You might need one or two temporary variables (`temp`), but you don't need a whole new array.

#### **2. Linear Space: **

The memory usage grows directly with the input size.

* **Example 1 (Data Structures):** Copying a list into a new list. If the original list has 100 items, the new one needs space for 100 items.
* **Example 2 (Recursion):** A recursive function that calls itself  times linearly. The "call stack" must hold  frames in memory.

#### **3. Logarithmic Space: **

This is common in divide-and-conquer algorithms where the recursion depth is logarithmic.

* **Example:** Quick Sort (in the standard implementation). While it sorts in place, it uses stack space for the recursion, and the height of that stack is usually .

#### **4. Quadratic Space: **

The memory usage grows by the square of the input.

* **Example:** Creating a 2D matrix (a grid) of size  to store data, often seen in Dynamic Programming solutions.

### **Key Concepts**

#### **Auxiliary Space vs. Space Complexity**

Technically, there is a subtle difference:

* **Space Complexity:** Total space used (Input size + Extra space).
* **Auxiliary Space:** The *extra* space or temporary space used by the algorithm (excluding the input data).
* *Practical Note:* In coding interviews, when someone asks for "Space Complexity," they are usually asking for the **Auxiliary Space**. They want to know "how much *extra* RAM will this cost me?"

#### **The Time-Space Trade-off**

Often, you can make an algorithm faster (better Time Complexity) by using more memory (worse Space Complexity).

* **Example:** A **Hash Map** uses  space to store data but allows for  lookups. You are "spending" memory to "buy" speed.
